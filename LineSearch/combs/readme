This module search for a line in data of all weeks.
To use, call
1. function combs_search( dataPath, lowFreq, highFreq, combFreq, offset, filter_multiplier, output_path )

data_path: the path that contains all weeks folder
lowFreq: the lower search bound
highFreq: the higher search bound
combFreq: the gap between harmonics of the comb
offset: the start frequency of the comb
filter_multiplier: the filter (how much a significant data should be greater than the average)
output_path: the folder where all the week folders locate in
	the output_path will be created
	the structure is output_path/<weeks>/<figures>

2. hierarchical structure: comb_search -> week_search -> channel -> output
